Hello everyone, I'm Natasha Piedrabuena. In this repository I have attached all the projects
I have been working on over the summer. 
The proects are built using python, c++ and/or java
1) Password Generator(Python)~mini project
            This project is a password generator that produces password based on the given parameter (length) specified by 
            user input. Then the output will result in a random password that wont repeat in values.
2) Fibonacci Sequence ~mini project
            This project is to calculate the fibonacci sequence depending on the number of terms that the user has entered. 
            After the user enter the number of terms it will output the result of the fibonacci sequences. 
3) Predict iphone prices
