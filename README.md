Hello everyone, I'm Natasha Piedrabuena. In this repository I have attached all the projects
I have been working on over the summer. 
The proects are built using python, c++ and/or java
1) Password Generator(Python)~mini project
            This project is a password generator that produces password based on the given parameter (length) specified by 
            user input. Then the output will result in a random password that wont repeat in values.
